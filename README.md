# Dimentionality-Reduction-MNIST-Dataset
The aim of this project is to dimensionality reduction of MNIST and find suitability of these techniques

1. The digit MNIST dataset can be downloaded from the link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ngbolin/mnist-dataset-digit-recognizer/data
2. In this we have applied PCA and t-SNE techniques to digit MNIST dataset
3. We have observed that t-SNE is a better technique over PCA for data visualisation purposes but it is computationally more expensive. 
4. Note: The technique are applied to partial datsets because of machine configuration constraints.
